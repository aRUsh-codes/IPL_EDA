## The steps that I took in this process were:-
*   ### **Load and inspect the data:**
    I started by loading and thoroughly understanding the dataset. I checked the structure of the dataset, including the columns, data types, and any missing values.

*   ### **Understand the variables:**
    In the next step I identified the key variables in the dataset, such as player names, teams, venues, dates, match results, batting and bowling statistics, etc. It help me understand the meaning and significance of each variable.

*   ### **Examine the distribution of variables:**
    In the next step, I Analyzed the distribution of numerical variables like runs, wickets, strike rates, etc., using descriptive statistics and visualizations and explored categorical variables like teams, venues, match outcomes (win/loss/tie), etc. Then I examined the frequency distribution of these variables and observed if any interesting trends or patterns.

*   ### **Analyze team performance:**
    Investigated the performance of different IPL teams over the years. Calculate team-wise statistics like runs scored, wickets taken, etc. Then Visualized the performance trends using line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps.

*   ### **Player analysis:**
    Focused on individual players and their performances. Then identified top performers based on metrics like highest run scorers, most wickets taken, highest batting averages, best bowling averages, etc. Then compared players' performance across different seasons or teams.

*   ### **Time-series analysis:**
    Analyzed the IPL data over time to understand the evolution of the league. Examine trends in team performance, player performance, match results, etc., across different seasons. Visualized these trends using line plots or time-series decomposition techniques.
